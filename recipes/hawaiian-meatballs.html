    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunk, juice reserved</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix together ground beef, ginger, garlic powder, and pepper 
            until well combined. Form into 1 1/2-inch meatballs.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Saute meatballs in a large frying pan over medium-high heat 
            until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove meatballs to a plate, 
            reserving the pan drippings.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            While the meatballs are cooking, pour juice from the canned 
            pineapple into a liquid measuring cup and add enough water 
            to make 1 cup. Mix brown sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Add pineapple juice and brown sugar mixtures to the warm pan 
            drippings. Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a boil. 
            Cook until sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Add meatballs, 
            pineapple chunks, and green pepper. Simmer until meatballs 
            are no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
