    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet set over 
            medium heat. Add the chicken, bell pepper, green onion and garlic.
            Cook and stir until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. 
            Remove the chicken to a plate and keep warm.

        <li>
            Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same skillet over 
            medium-high heat. Add the rice; cook and stir to heat through. 
            Stir in the soy sauce, rice vinegar and peas, and continue to 
            cook for 1 minute. Return the chicken mixture to the skillet and 
            stir to blend with the rice and heat through before serving.
